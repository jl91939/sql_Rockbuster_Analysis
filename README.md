# Project Brief: Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis.
## Introduction
In this project, I assume the role of a data analyst for Rockbuster Stealth's business intelligence department to help with launch strategy for their new online video service. The BI Department helps other departments with data related queries from inventory to customer insights. My first task is to load all of Rockbuster's data into a relational database management system, then use SQL to analyze the data to answer AD-HOC business questions that other departments may have.
